# React.js + SCSS Artificial Intelligence & OpenAI Services Website

GPT3 is a "Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3" which basically means a language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. It is created by the OpenAI lab. 

The quality of the text generated by GPT-3 is so high that it can be difficult to determine whether or not it was written by a human, which has both benefits and risks.

To build this app I've used React functional components and SCSS stylesheets
